# dataplus
Dataplus was written as I saw myself constantly writing small apps to manage basic data.
I decided that writing one customisable database program would save me time.

Dataplus is written in python and allows tables, columns and rows to be created and designed all within the GUI,
there are many datatypes avalible which all have features relevant to their data. Eg. file cells allow for a file upload dialoge and date fields come with a date picker

Dataplus must be run under python3
